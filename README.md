# cardgamelib

This is my WIP of a Java library for implementing card games. I started it
in summer 2013, but it is at the moment incomplete.

My goal was to develop a framework that would allow one to quickly implement an
arbitrary card game, be able to stand up a server to host that game, and
develop agents to play that game (whether controlled by humans or AI).

There are two Eclipse projects in this repo at the moment, `cardgamelib`, which
is the (incomplete) framework itself, and `presidents`, which is an (incomplete)
implementation of a card game I learned last summer, Presidents.
